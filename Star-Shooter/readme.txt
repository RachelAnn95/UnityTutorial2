Unity Tutorial 2 readme file

I completed the tutorial, build it correctly, and saved it as an executable named "Main."

For my "something unique" I added to new types of asteroids. One type will appear 3 times for every 10 times one of the original asteroids shows up and is worth 50 points. The second one will show up 1 time for every 10 times the original asteroids showed up and is worth 100 points.
